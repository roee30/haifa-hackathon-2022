# haifa-hackathon-2022

My contribution to the team in Haifa's liberal arts hackathon of 19-20.5.2022.

The team's goal was to measure and visualize distance between different medieval texts in Hebrew, Arabic and Judeo-Arabic.

## bag_of_words.py

Scan a directory for `.txt` files, generate a bag of words from them and export to a csv file.

## camel.py

Arabic stemming: replace words by their stem. Also removes tashkil.

## main.py

Clean Hebrew text: remove unnecessary whitespace, english, digits and niqqud.
